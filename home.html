<h2>ABSTRACT</h2>
<p class="abstract1">
It is known that nanoparticles spread regularly on a surface can reflect selectively light around certain wavelengths based on the size and structure of the nanoparticles’ array.
In this study, we design an optical filter that polarizes ultraviolet rays. This filter is composed of multiple rectangular DNA origamis from Rothemund et al., bound to each other to make a wide DNA sheet.
 By using a DNA sheet, we are able to accurately create an even distribution of gold particles. Additionally, multiple particles are attached to each DNA origami, as a way to have fault-tolerance to erroneous configurations of the DNA sheet. At the same time, we devised the Tm of bounding DNA sequences carefully to prevent as much as possible such configurations from happening.

<p class="abstract2">
This optical filter is a material that both reflects UVs while being transparent at other wavelengths and may enable us to create novel transparent UV cut material, which could be used for glasses and windows, for instance.
